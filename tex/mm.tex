\begin{abstract}
\noindent
Large-scale photometric surveys have revealed that the halo of the Milky Way is crisscrossed with cold stellar streams.
These structures are faint and diffuse, so out of several dozen of discovered streams, only a handful have been followed up spectroscopically.
Within the Moving Mesh project, we are employing large field-of-view spectroscopes on 6.5\,m telescopes to kinematically characterize cold streams in the Milky Way.
This is the first in a series of Moving Mesh papers, where we targeted the disrupting globular cluster NGC~5466 and a distant stellar stream Styx, and provide kinematic information of their tidal debris for the first time.

% Tidal tails around NGC~5466 were discovered by \citet{belokurov2006} and \citet{gj2006}.


\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}
We observed the tidal tails of NGC~5466 and Styx stellar streams with MMT/Hectochelle \citep{hectospec} in February and May 2017.
The observations were taken using the 110\,$l$/mm grating and the `RV31' order-blocking filter over the wavelength range 5150--5300\,\AA, with exposure times of 1.5\,hours per field.
A total of three NGC~5466 and four Styx fields were observed.
The basic image reduction was done by the TDC \citep{hectoredux}, and the radial velocities were measured following \citet{caldwell2017}.
Out of 739 targets along the NGC~5466 tidal tails, we were able to obtain radial velocities for 251 stars.
For Styx, the success rate was higher, and radial velocity measurements were made for 604 out of 867 targeted stars.
Median velocity uncertainty is $\lesssim1\;$km/s for both streams.
Our preliminary results are summarized in Figures~\ref{fig:summary_ngc5466} and \ref{fig:summary_styx} for NGC~5466 and Styx, respectively.

(\emph{Left}) Velocity distribution of MMT/Hectochelle targets with well-measured radial velocities (empty black histogram).
The expected distribution for a smooth halo from the Besan\c{c}on model is shown as an orange-filled histogram.
We define kinematic membership to the NGC~5466 stream for stars with radial velocities between $\sim80-140\;$km/s, where the Milky Way measurements show a clear overabundance, and highlight this range in gray.
(\emph{Center}) Color-magnitude diagram of targeted stars (gray) and kinematic members (black).
Targets were selected using an old and metal-poor isochrone at a distance of 16.2\,kpc.
Several of the potential member stars are on the BHB, while the rest are at the main sequence turn-off ($r\sim19$), with very few members along the RGB.
(\emph{Right}) Radial velocity of NGC~5466 members as a function of R.A.
Close to the cluster ($\rm R.A.=211.364^\circ$), there is no discernible gradient in radial velocity, but potential members in the most distant field, $\rm R.A.\approx202.5^\circ$, have a large velocity spread.}

(\emph{Left}) Velocity distribution of MMT/Hectochelle targets with well-measured radial velocities (empty black histogram).
The expected distribution for a smooth halo from the Besan\c{c}on model is shown as an orange-filled histogram.
We define kinematic membership to the Styx stream for stars with radial velocities between $-240\;$km/s and $-120\;$km/s, where the Milky Way measurements show a clear overabundance, and highlight this range in gray.
(\emph{Center}) Color-magnitude diagram of targeted stars (gray) and kinematic members (black).
Targets were selected using an old and metal-poor isochrone at a distance of 48\,kpc.
Some of the kinematic members are potentially BHB stars ($g-r\lesssim0.4$), while most are found along the RGB.
(\emph{Right}) Radial velocity of Styx members as a function of R.A.
The contamination from the Milky Way foreground among the potential kinematic members is on the order of $\sim50\%$, so determining the radial velocity along the stream more precisely would benefit from measuring surface gravities and removing dwarf stars from this sample.}
